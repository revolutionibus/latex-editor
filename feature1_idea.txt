# Want to beautify the look as close as possible to Overleaf


# Ideas
## Make a space for the logo
## Make the files selectable


### I want to add the HEPCAT logo here

#### I have a plan to give people the option to open the pdf editor in a new tab.
#### Also I need to fix the code so that uploaded file can be shown immediately to the files tab
